# block_non_au_ips
Script to insert iptables rules to block all non-AU IP traffic. --remove removes all these rules from iptables

This script is being developed.
Use at your own risk

Important note: It's probably best you run this in a VM instead of your host/main system lest the firewalls or their remove screws up your current firewall rules.
